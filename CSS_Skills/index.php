            <p>Deliverance is an American Christian thrash metal band which 
                later shifted more towards heavy metal and progressive metal. 
                Founded by Jimmy P. Brown II in 1985, many members have either 
                stayed in the lineup for a number of years, or left and returned
                to the lineup. Jimmy P. Brown II has been the only constant 
                member of Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Deliverance formed in 1985 as a speed metal outfit, where the 
               Christian metal community first encountered them on the 
               compilation album California Metal. They put forth their 
               self-titled debut album Deliverance in 1989 with 
               Jimmy P. Brown II (guitars and lead vocals), Glenn Rogers (lead guitar), 
               Brian Khairullah (bass), and Chris Hyde (drums). In 1989, 
               Deliverance's track "If You Will" from their self-titled album 
               appeared on Hot Metal Summer II along with a recorded interview.</p>
            <p>Deliverance garnered significant attention in the Christian metal 
               community with their 1990 release Weapons of Our Warfare. During
               this time, the band replaced guitarist Glenn Rogers with George Ochoa.
               Deliverance released a video on MTV for the title track of Weapons. 
               The track was also included on Intense Records compilation album
               Hot Metal Summer III Hot Licks - Cold Facts.</p>
            <p>During the production of their third album, What a Joke, 
               Brian Khairullah and Chris Hyde were replaced with Mike Grato 
               and Kevin Lee respectively. The album did not perform as well, 
               and tensions within the band resulted in the departure of George Ochoa.</p>
            <p>Their fourth album was a major change in direction for the band musically.
               Stay of Execution went in a more progressive metal direction, 
               complete with new guitarist Mike Phillips.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Doug Van Pelt of HM Magazine, when asked 
                about the musical change, Jimmy P. Brown explained:</p>
            <p>"I got tired of being labeled 'Oh, there's Deliverance.... 
                the Metallica clones are back.' You know, that got really old. 
                Because in a sense we were kind of ripping them off. 
                But I definitely know that the Lord wants us to be original. 
                I want to be original. So I think it was time."
                — HM Video Magazine</p>
            <p>While this move did anger fans at the time, others feel that Stay 
               represents Deliverance's best work. Their fifth album, Learn, 
               continued in a progressive direction with new bassist Manny Morales
               and lead guitarist Jonathan Maddux. From this time on, the other 
               positions in the band changed with increasing frequency, but the 
               core of the band remained Jimmy Brown and Manny Morales.</p>
            <p>Deliverance released River Disturbance in 1994 and 
               Camelot in Smithereens in 1995. Camelot was the poorest seller in
               the Deliverance catalog at the time.</p>
            <p>After a four-year hiatus, Deliverance resurfaced in 2000 and 
               began recording their next studio album, Assimilation, which was 
               released in the following year. Assimilation represented another 
               change in style with a shift towards a more electronic/industrial
               sound. Deliverance again retreated until 2006.</p>
            <p>In 2006, Deliverance reformed with a lineup of Jimmy P. Brown II,
               Mike Phillips, Corin Jae Scott, Tim Kronyak, and Mike Reed. 
               The band's next album As Above - So Below was released on 
               April 24, 2007. Full length songs from the album can currently be
               heard on the band's official MySpace page. The album featured a
               mix of all their past material (musically) with some more modern 
               metal elements.</p>
            <p>Deliverance announced they would be releasing a new album sometime 
               in 2010 called The Annals of Subterfuge. This would mark 
               Deliverance's 25th Anniversary. Though rumors persist of reuniting 
               with past members, it became apparent that Jimmy would be recording 
               the upcoming album with Mike Phillips.</p>
            <p>Though the group officially disbanded in 1996, there have been fan 
               demands for concert performances and new albums which caused the 
               intermittent reunions every 4–5 years. Jimmy P. Brown II has spent 
               the past 10 years working in the casino industry in Las Vegas, but 
               currently resides in Alabama continuing his career with the casino industry.
               Jimmy has been quoted as saying: "I moved to Alabama to be close 
               with my family, and to try regain normalcy for my family. Having 
               lived in the fantasy land of Las Vegas for the past 10 years, I wanted
               to stay in the casino biz, but didn't want my kids growing up the Vegas way".</p>
            <p>In 2010, Deliverance played the only show without Jimmy P. Brown II at NordicFest.</p>
            <p>On May 20, 2011 Mike Phillips announced that Deliverance was finally 
                coming to end and would be performing their final show in August 2011.
                However, by July 2012, Deliverance had resurfaced again and been
                working on their tenth studio album Hear What I Say!, which was 
                released on September 3, 2013 on Roxx Records and would be their final album. 
                However, Jimmy Brown recently has stated that Hear What I Say! 
                will most likely not be their final album.</p>
            <p>Though Brown stated that Hear What I Say! would be the last album, 
                he announced that Deliverance has new material to release in 2016. 
                The band, whose lineup consists of former guitarist George Ochoa,
                former drummer Jim Chaffin and bassist Victor Máciás, played Exodo
                Fest in Mexico with Silent Planet and Grave Robber.</p>
